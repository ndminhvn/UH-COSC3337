    "### __About The Data__\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we'll be using has the following attributes related to heart disease. It's the same data set as from HW3, so that way you'll be familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: age of the patient (years)\n",
    "- anaemia: decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)\n",
    "- high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean)\n",
    "- creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)\n",
    "- diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean)\n",
    "- ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)\n",
    "- platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)\n",
    "- sex: female or male (binary)\n",
    "- serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)\n",
    "- serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)\n",
    "- smoking: if the patient smokes or not (boolean)\n",
    "- time: follow-up period (days)\n",
    "- [target] death: if the patient died during the follow-up period (boolean) \n",
    "\n",
    "For each ```boolean``` variable, a value of 1 = True and 0 = False. For sex, female = 0 and male = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Problem Statement__\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, data science tasks usually involve some sort of stakeholder who wants to learn something from the data, but don't know what to do. That's where you, the data scientist, come in! As part of a consultant group, you are a data scientist who has been contracted by a research team of cardiologists to try and better understand their group of patients. Specifically, they would like for you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict patient survival\n",
    "- Find if there are any important features related to patient survival\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be using Clustering to identify clusters of patients, then seeing how well the various clustering methods work against the true clusters (classes). A good resource to use would be [Sci-Kit Learn's Clustering info](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Notes__\n",
    "\n",
    "** For the homework assignments, we want you to not only use the tools given in class, but also to be able to _interpret_ the results. There are subjective questions, and the grading will be weighted not necessarily on your conclusion, but how you support your conclusion. To do this, you will need to conceptually understand the methods given in class in order to explain results.\n",
    "\n",
    "** As a tip, remember that if you're struggling to understand a function or how to use it, each of these packages has documentation on its website that explains exactly how to use it with examples. Google is your friend :)\n",
    "\n",
    "** Also, when trying to mimic our results, yours does not need to look exactly like the one given, as long as it is readable __and__ answers the question convincingly. Adding comments to code with \"#\" helps us to understand what you did or were trying to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Please turn in a Jupyter notebook containing your code, its output, and your answers with the file name: \n",
    "\n",
    "LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_3337_HW4.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "If you submit a zip file or anything else, you will receive -5 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Part 1. Importing Libraries__\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by importing the necessary libraries that you'll be using. Add any you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, libraries/packages are groups of functions and classes that don't come standard with Python. We are importing these packages so that we can use already-made functions, instead of having to create our own.\n"
